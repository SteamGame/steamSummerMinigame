This fork has:
* Elemental damage prioritizing, gold prioritizing
* Auto clicking
* Tickrate set to 1000ms every second
* Disable most particles
* Auto use abilities
* idk


## Features ##

- Moves you to the lane most likely to give you gold, prioritized like so:
	1. The lane with a Treasure Minion or Boss
	2. The lane with the Miniboss with the lowest health
	3. The lane with a Spawner below 40% health
	4. The lane with a Creep below 10% health
	5. The lane with the Spawner with the lowest health
- Activates most reusable abilities, if they are purchased and cooled down:
	- Medics if your health is below 50%
	- Morale Booster, Napalm, and Cluster Bombs if the lane has a Spawner and 2-3 Creeps
	- Good Luck Charm as soon as possible
	- Tactical Nuke if the current Spawner is between 60% and 30% health
- Activates some items if you have them and the situation calls for them:
	- God Mode if Medics is in cooldown and your health is low
	- Cripple Spawner if the spawner in the current lane has more than 95% health
	- Gold Rain if facing a Boss who has more than 60% health
- Respawns you after 5 seconds (instead of 1 minute) if you die
- Disables certain abilities and items if facing a Boss (to try to maximize Raining Gold and Metal Detector benefits)

## I want to contribute! ##

This project is open-source on github. There are different ways you can help:

- Find a Pull Request that's marked `needs testing`. Run that version of the script for a while and watch the console for errors. If there's no errors, pay attention to what the changes are doing gameplay-wise, and make sure it's doing what it's supposed to do.
- Find an Issue that's marked `help wanted`. Make the changes needed by that issue, and create a Pull Request with your enhancement or bugfix.
- Pick an item off the TODO list, below, and implement it. When it's done (and tested and working), create a Pull Request.
- Got an idea for an improvement that's not already listed? Code it up, test it out, then make a Pull Request when it's ready.

### Pull Request Guidelines ###

- Do NOT change the script version in your PR as it could be incremented before your PR is merged.
- Test your changes both in console and Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey.
- Squash your commits before submitting the PR.
